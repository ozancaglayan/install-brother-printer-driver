This simple script dynamically renders a list of Brother printer models
and installs the selected one from i386 binary RPM's onto your system.

It's basically designed for use with Pardus (http://www.pardus.org.tr/eng)
but it also checks for the existence of RPM utility and uses that for
installation.

Requirements
-------------

- Python BeautifulSoup
- tcsh (needed by many Brother filters)
- kdialog (For KDE4 user interaction)
- dbus-python (For kdialog interaction over D-Bus)

Note that this should currently be run as root with xdg-su or something
similar like xdg-su.
